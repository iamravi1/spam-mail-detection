# Spam-mail-detectionðŸ“¨
> A Deep learning model to identify the spam mail using BERT pre trained model.
## The Pipeline Overview for Spam Detection Using BERT
To build the system ourselves we are going to follow these procedures:

1. Load Data â€“ We will be loading our data which is simple [2 categories(ham and spam) along with corresponding emails] CSV file. The file can be found here

2. EDA â€“ Perform some EDA to get a feel of what data looks like â€“ statistics here!

3. Pre Processing â€“ Based on the results of EDA we will be going to apply some preprocessing to the data to make it model friendly

4. Model Creation â€“ We will use Functional API* to build our Deep Learning Model which will consist of

- INPUT â€“ Will create an input layer that will take in all the pre-processing data and pass it to bert_processor.
- BERT PREPROCESSOR â€“ Process our input text to be in the format which encoder accepts. (adds MASK AND ENCODINGS).
- BERT ENCODER â€“ Feed our processed text to the bert model which will eventually generate a contextualized word embedding for our training data.
- DROPOUT â€“ Add a dropout layer that will randomly drop out a few neurons from the network to take care overfitting problem.
- SOFTMAX â€“ At last we will add a softmax layer to predict data in 2 categories.

5. Model Evaluation â€“ Further we will check how the model performs on the test data and plot some relevant charts and metrics based on the observations.

6. Predict Data â€“ Finally we will predict our own emails using the model.
